Hey Guys, so sorry I've been plagued with work, I can do the graphics tonight but they will be here late, so maybe you can code them in tomorrow afternoon?
Thanks so much for your patience, and hey, if we can't do it in time, we have a more complete game next year! Ok guys, they'll be here tonight!


Love- Miles



Yeah, cuz even if u do make the graphics in time, we're not gonna be able to incorporate our full game concept…
we can still submit, but maybe we'll do it again next year :P

Still, I want to see this game finished - it will kick ass.
All graphics are done.
It's 1:12 AM.
I should sleep.
Thanks all! Let's finish rõbä†!
